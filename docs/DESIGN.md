## Overview

Vercel is a developer-platform brand — the page is a deployment dashboard's marketing surface, written for engineers who already know the syntax. It earns that posture with one of the cleanest stark systems on the web: near-white `{colors.canvas-soft}` body background, ink-near-black `{colors.ink}` text, a 200-step gray scale that gives every divider, border, and disabled state its own deliberate step. The only place the brand introduces colour at marketing scale is the multi-stop mesh gradient (`{colors.gradient-develop-start}` → `{colors.gradient-preview-end}` → `{colors.gradient-ship-start}` → cyan / magenta / amber) that floats in atmospheric backdrops, never miniaturised to a swatch. That gradient is the entire decoration system.

Type is the second decisive voice. The brand's own custom geometric sans (Geist) carries display, body, button — everything narrative — at weight 600 for display, 500 for buttons, 400 for body. A matching monospaced face (Geist Mono) carries technical labels: terminal mockups, code blocks, sometimes filename captions. Headlines are sentence-case with aggressive negative letter-spacing (`-2.4px` at 48 px hero) — the brand never letter-spaces positively, never goes uppercase outside of mono labels.

Surfaces use a four-step ladder: `{colors.canvas}` (pure white for cards), `{colors.canvas-soft}` 98% (the page body), `{colors.canvas-soft-2}` 95% (occasional inset region), `{colors.primary}` (the deep ink-near-black used as the polarity-flipped band when a section needs the dark mode treatment). Shadows are exceptionally subtle — every elevated card carries a stacked shadow built from `0px 1px 1px #00000005` + `0px 2px 2px #0000000a` + an inset border. Cards never float on heavy drop-shadow; they sit on the page held by hairline + soft glow.

**Key Characteristics:**
- A single black-ink primary CTA `{colors.primary}` carries every conversion target, paired with white-on-white `button-secondary` for the secondary action. The brand uses 100 px pill shape for marketing CTAs and a tight 6 px square shape for in-app nav buttons.
- A multi-stop mesh gradient (cyan-blue-magenta-amber) is the only decorative chrome — used at hero scale and inside feature-band atmospheric backdrops. It is the brand.
- Every section eyebrow and small label uses the monospace face `{typography.caption-mono}` or `{typography.code}`; everything else is in the geometric sans.
- Subtle stacked-shadow elevation — three offsets layered with 4-12 % black opacity — never a single heavy drop-shadow.
- A complete 100–1000 gray + blue + red + amber + green + teal + purple + pink colour scale exists as a system token set, but the marketing surface uses only the `100`, `1000`, and `700`-level tones; the rest stay in the design-system tokens for in-product surfaces.
- An "Active CPU" pricing rhythm: `pricing-card` lays out 3-up on the pricing page with `pricing-card-featured` (Pro tier) polarity-flipped to `{colors.primary}` against white-card siblings.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Ink** (`{colors.primary}` — `#171717`): The single primary CTA color. Black-near-pure ink that carries every Sign Up pill, every footer CTA, the dark-band polarity-flip. Used as text color throughout the page on light surfaces. (Resolved from `--ds-gray-1000`.)
- **Cyan** (`{colors.cyan}` — `#50e3c2`): A signature mint-cyan used in the brand gradient and inside Geist-system spotlight tokens. Visible inside the hero gradient stops.
- **Highlight Pink** (`{colors.highlight-pink}` — `#ff0080`): The brand's highlight magenta, used as the high-saturation stop in the preview-gradient pair.
- **Violet** (`{colors.violet}` — `#7928ca`): The deep purple used as the start of the preview-gradient and inside developer-console highlights.
- **Link Blue** (`{colors.link}` — `#0070f3`): The brand's primary link color and the legacy `--geist-success` semantic.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): The pure-white card / dialog / modal surface.
- **Canvas Soft** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — `#fafafa`): The default page background — 98 % white. Almost every section sits on this tone.
- **Canvas Soft 2** (`{colors.canvas-soft-2}` — `#f5f5f5`): A slightly deeper inset surface for "code editor inner background", template-card hover states, and dropdown menus.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#ebebeb`): 1 px dividers — table rows, card borders, input borders.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#a1a1a1`): The 500-level gray, used as the slightly-stronger divider on light bands and as the deemphasised text color.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#171717`): Every heading and body paragraph on light surfaces.
- **Body** (`{colors.body}` — `#4d4d4d`): Secondary text — sub-headings, body captions, nav-link inactive text, footer column body.
- **Mute** (`{colors.mute}` — `#888888`): Lowest-priority text — placeholder text, fine print, low-key labels.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): All text on `{colors.primary}` surfaces.

### Semantic
- **Success / Link** (`{colors.success}` — `#0070f3`): The brand's legacy success indicator doubles as the primary link color. Visible underline-on-hover for inline body links.
- **Link Deep** (`{colors.link-deep}` — `#0761d1`): The pressed / visited tone for inline links.
- **Link Bg Soft** (`{colors.link-bg-soft}` — `#d3e5ff`): Soft pastel blue fill for "what's new" pill banners and informational badges.
- **Error** (`{colors.error}` — `#ee0000`): Validation red for destructive actions and form errors.
- **Error Soft** (`{colors.error-soft}` — `#f7d4d6`): Soft pastel red for destructive-state backgrounds.
- **Error Deep** (`{colors.error-deep}` — `#c50000`): Pressed / deep destructive state.
- **Warning** (`{colors.warning}` — `#f5a623`): Caution / pending status indicator.
- **Warning Soft** (`{colors.warning-soft}` — `#ffefcf`) / **Warning Deep** (`{colors.warning-deep}` — `#ab570a`): Background + pressed variants.

### Brand Gradient
The brand's signature decoration is a three-pair gradient stack:
- **Develop** (`{colors.gradient-develop-start}` `#007cf0` → `{colors.gradient-develop-end}` `#00dfd8`) — the blue-to-teal pair used to mark the "deploy" / "develop" rhythm.
- **Preview** (`{colors.gradient-preview-start}` `#7928ca` → `{colors.gradient-preview-end}` `#ff0080`) — the violet-to-pink pair used for "preview" surfaces.
- **Ship** (`{colors.gradient-ship-start}` `#ff4d4d` → `{colors.gradient-ship-end}` `#f9cb28`) — the coral-to-amber pair used for "ship" surfaces.

The three pairs collapse into a single multi-color mesh gradient when used as the hero atmospheric backdrop. Treat the gradient as one unified object — do not crop down to a single colour, do not reorder the stops, and do not miniaturise. Used at hero scale only.

## Typography

### Font Family
Two custom faces carry the entire system:

1. **Geist** — display, body, button, link, label. Weights 400 / 500 / 600.
2. **Geist Mono** — terminal mockups, code blocks, mono-caption labels. Weight 400 at 12–13 px.

Substitutes: Inter (sans), JetBrains Mono (mono).
